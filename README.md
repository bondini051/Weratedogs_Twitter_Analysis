# Weratedogs_Twitter_Analysis

This project was completed for Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree.  There are three data sets cleaned. Those cleaned datasets are then analysed in this project. 

- image_predictions.tsv - Neural network to predict what the type of dog is in the picture
- img_cleaned.csv - Above dataset cleaned and saved in CSV format
- tweet_json.txt - JSON text file scraped from Twitter API of @WeRateDogs
- json_txt_cleaned.csv - Cleaned JSON text file
- twitter_archive_inhanced.csv - Twitter data given by Udacity.
- twitter_archive_cleaned.csv - cleaned version of previous data
- twitter_archive_master.csv - cleaned version of merged data from img_cleaned.csv, json_txt_cleaned.csv, twitter_archive_cleaned.csv

The tweets run up to August 2017. In the cleaned twitter_archive_master.csv there are 21 columns and 1947 rows in this dataset.  

The goal of this project is to analyse the data and give 3-4 insights as well as give some visualization to improve these insights. 

There are two written reports attached to the project:
  - wrangle_report.pdf
  - act_report.pdf
